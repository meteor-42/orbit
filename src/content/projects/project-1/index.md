# Metero-42: Decentralized VPN Access

## Overview

**Meteor-42** is an ERC-20 token on Arbitrum L2 that allows users to securely access WireGuard-based VPN nodes. Users simply hold or spend tokens to unlock temporary VPN sessions, all powered by smart contracts and zero centralized trust.

**Core Features:**

* Token-gated access to VPN via WireGuard
* Full Web3 frontend with MetaMask/WalletConnect
* Decentralized VPN node architecture
* Governance through DAO
* L2 deployment on Arbitrum for low fees

## Motivation

Traditional VPNs rely on centralized providers. This creates privacy concerns, censorship risk, and limited transparency. Metero-42 eliminates these problems by decentralizing VPN access:

| Problem                | Traditional VPN        | Metero-42                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Central Control        | Yes                    | No (DAO governed)             |
| Token Utility          | No                     | Yes (Metero-42 powers access) |
| Privacy                | Provider logs metadata | Smart contract-based gateway  |
| Cost Transparency      | Monthly billing        | Pay-as-you-use via token      |
| Geographic Flexibility | Limited server choice  | Community-deployed nodes      |

## How It Works

    A[User with Metero-42 tokens] --> B[Connect Wallet]
    B --> C[Smart Contract]
    C --> D[Check Balance / Signature]
    D --> E[Allow VPN Access (Time-bound)]
    E --> F[User gets WG config via UI or Bot]
```

* **Smart Contract** on Arbitrum manages token balances and access control.
* **WireGuard Node** checks for valid token signature (JWT or relay).
* **VPN Config** is served dynamically for a limited time window.

### Architecture Table

| Component       | Description                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Metero-42 Token | ERC-20 token on Arbitrum used for access     |
| Access Contract | Manages verification and time-based tokens   |
| VPN Node Agent  | Listens for valid keys, issues WireGuard cfg |
| Frontend (Web3) | Web UI for claiming access and configs       |
| Telegram Bot    | Allows mobile-based access and automation    |

## Future Vision

* **Decentralized VPN Marketplace**: anyone can run a node, earn tokens.
* **Metero-42 Utility Expansion**: gateways to IPFS, proxies, dApps.
* **Mobile App**: One-click VPN on Android/iOS using WalletConnect.
* **L2 Governance**: Fully community-shaped roadmap and upgrades.
